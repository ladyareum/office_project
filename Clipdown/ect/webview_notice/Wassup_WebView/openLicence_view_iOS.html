										<li>
										"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object

								this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
								worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
								copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
								publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
								Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
								</li>
								<li>
								3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
								this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
								worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
								(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

								by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
								Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

								institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
								cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
								or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
								or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
								granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
								as of the date such litigation is filed.							
								</li>
								<li>
								4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
								Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
								modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
								meet the following conditions:		
									<ul class="list_1depth">
										<li>
										<span class="text_num">(a)</span>You must give any other recipients of the Work or
										Derivative Works a copy of this License; and										
										</li>
										<li>
										<span class="text_num">(b)</span>You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
										stating that You changed the files; and
										</li>										
										<li>
										<span class="text_num">(c)</span>You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
										that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
										attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
										excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
										the Derivative Works; and
										</li>
										<li>
										<span class="text_num">(d)</span>If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
										distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
										include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
										within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
										pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
										of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
										as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
										documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
										within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
										wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
										of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
										do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
										notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
										or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
										that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
										as modifying the License.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<p style="margin-top:-30px;">
									You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
									may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
									for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
									for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
									reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
									the conditions stated in this License.	
									</p>																			
								</li>
								<li>
								5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
								any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
								by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
								this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
								Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
								the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
								with Licensor regarding such Contributions.					
								</li>
								<li>
								6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
								names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
								except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
								origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.							
								</li>
								<li>
								7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
								agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
								Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
								WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
								implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
								of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
								PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
								appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
								risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

								appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
								risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
							
								</li>
								<li>
								8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
								whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
								unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
								negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
								liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
								incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
								result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
								Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
								work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
								other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
								has been advised of the possibility of such damages.							
								</li>
								<li>
								9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
								the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
								and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
								or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
								License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
								on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
								of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
								defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
								incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
								of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
